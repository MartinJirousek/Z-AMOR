<h1>Topic 1 – The Cell</h1>

<p>The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of living organisms. According to differences in their phylogeny, size, and the internal organization of their cells, organisms can be divided into two groups: prokaryotes and eukaryotes.</p>

<p>Prokaryotic organisms include bacteria of two domains, Bacteria (Eubacteria) and Archaea (Archaebacteria), the latter as a special group of extreme habitats with high temperatures, extreme pH levels, or high salt concentrations. Procaryotes appeared approximately 3.5–3.8 billion years ago, long before eukaryotes.</p>

<p>Main differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells:

<h2>Procaryotic cell</h2>

<p>Prokaryotic cells are generally very small, typically 0.1–5.0 µm in diameter. Their small size allows rapid growth, division, and efficient nutrient exchange.</p>

<p>Most of the cell DNA form a single circular chromosome. Unlike eukaryotic chromosomes, it is not enclosed by a nuclear membrane and is instead located in a region of the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. In addition to the main chromosome, many prokaryotes also contain smaller, circular DNA molecules called plasmids, which carry extra genetic traits such as antibiotic resistance, but these are not considered part of the chromosome.</p>

<p>The interior of a procaryotic cell contains further cytoplasm, numerous ribosomes, optional plasmids, storage granules, and a simple cytoskeleton. Some bacteria also contain specialized compartments like carboxysomes or gas vesicles.</p>

<p>The surface of bacteria consists of a protective cell wall, one or two cytoplasmatic membranes, and often additional outer structures such as capsules, mucoid sheath, slime coat, pili, or flagella. Together, these layers protect the cell, help it adhere to surfaces, and enable movement and interaction with the environment. Procaryotic cells lack most of specialized structures or organelles of eukaryotic cells.</p>

<h3>Cyanophytes (Cyanobacteria)</h3>
<p>Cyanophytes (Cyanobacteria), are a very specialized group of prokaryotes distinguished by their ability to perform oxygenic photosynthesis, similar to plants. Their cells contain a rich system of photosynthetic pigments, primarily chlorophyll a, various carotenoids, and especially phycobiliproteins (phycocyanin and phycoerythrin), which give them their characteristic blue green coloration. The photosynthetic machinery of Cyanophytes is organized in the cytoplasm into numerous thylakoid membranes, arranged as parallel flattened sacs.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Eucaryotic cell</h2>

<p>Eukaryotes originated from one archaeal host and one bacterial symbiont (the ancestor of mitochondria), in case of eucaryotic plant cells even two symbionts, because chloroplasts evolved from cyanophytes. Eukaryotic cells are characteristic of plants, fungi, animals, and many other groups of organisms. Most eukaryotic cells size range between 10 and 100 µm in diameter.</p>

<p>To be precise, eukaryotic cells vary enormously in size. The smallest free living eukaryotic cells belong to the green alga Ostreococcus tauri, which measures only about 0.8 µm in diameter and is even smaller than many bacteria. In land plants, the smallest cells are typically meristematic cells in growing tissues and small pollen grains, usually around 5–10 µm.</p>

<p>At the opposite extreme, the largest eukaryotic cell on Earth is the ostrich egg, whose unfertilized ovum reaches 7–8 cm in diameter. Plants also possess exceptionally large single cells, the green alga Acetabularia is a single coenocytic cell up to 5–10 cm tall. Other plant cells, such as wood vessel elements or pollen tubes, may extend for several millimeters or even centimeters, although they are very narrow.</p>

<h3>Cellular Organization</h3>

<p>The eukaryotic cell is divided by biological membranes into so‑called compartments that carry out different functions. DNA is located primarily in the cell nucleus, which is enclosed by the nuclear envelope—a double‑membrane barrier surrounding the nucleus.</p>

<p>The living part of the cell (the protoplast) is bounded by a single cytoplasmic biomembrane, the plasma membrane, and contains the nucleus and other organelles, membrane systems, vacuoles, spherosomes, and small particles known as cell inclusions. All these structures are dispersed in the fundamental substance of the cytoplasm, the cytosol—a semi‑transparent, gel‑like fluid in which many metabolic reactions take place.</p>

<p>Three organelles—the nucleus, plastids (in case of the plant cells only), and mitochondria—are enclosed by double membranes, while vacuoles, dictyosomes (which form the Golgi apparatus), the endoplasmic reticulum, and various vesicles are surrounded by single membranes. Ribosomes are non‑membranous structures.</p>

<p>In contrast to animal cells, a plant eukaryotic cell is covered on the outside by a cell wall and contains vacuoles and plastids. Fungal cells are also surrounded by a cell wall and contain membrane‑bound vacuoles similar in function to those in plant cells, but they lack plastids.</p>

<h2>Cell Wall</h2>

<p>The presence of a cell wall is one of the characteristics distinguishing plant cells from animal cells. The cell wall limits the size of the protoplast and prevents rupture when the cell enlarges due to water uptake into the cell. It is important in absorption, transport, and secretion of substances, in signal perception, and in interactions with pathogens and symbionts. The cell wall determines where and how a cell can grow, making it a key driver of plant shape and organ formation. The cell wall may grow in thickness (apposition) or in surface area (intussusception).</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>The structure of the plant cell wall can be described in distinct layers arranged between the protoplasts of neighboring cells. Two fundamental layers are recognized: the middle lamella and the primary cell wall. The middle lamella, located between adjacent cells, is rich in pectins and serves as the cementing layer that binds neighboring cell walls together. Internal to it lies the primary wall, a flexible structure present in growing cells.</p>

<p>In some cell types, once growth ceases, a secondary cell wall is deposited inside the primary wall. This secondary wall is much thicker, contains high amounts of cellulose and lignin, and lacks pectins and glycoproteins, making it mechanically rigid. Such reinforced walls occur in cells specialized for mechanical support or water conduction, where the protoplast typically dies after the secondary wall is completed.</p>

<h3>Chemical Composition</h3>
<p>Chemically, the architecture of the primary cell wall is determined by a cellulose microfibril framework, which provides tensile strength. This framework is embedded in a matrix of hemicelluloses and pectins, which influence wall flexibility and hydration. The wall also contains glycoproteins, such as extensin, which contribute to structural integrity.</p>

<p>Many cell walls further accumulate lignin, enhancing stiffness, or lipid derived substances such as cutin, suberin, and waxes, which function in waterproofing. Additionally, walls may become incrusted with inorganic compounds such as silica (SiO₂) or calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).</p>

<h3>Pits and Plasmodesmata</h3>
<p>Despite being a rigid structure, the cell wall contains regions of deliberate thinning known as pits. Through these pits pass cytoplasmic bridges called plasmodesmata, which traverse the walls of neighboring cells.</p>

<p>Plasmodesmata provide symplastic continuity between protoplasts, enabling the exchange of signals, metabolites, and water, and ensuring coordinated development and physiological integration across plant tissues.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Biomembrane System</h2>

<p>All membranes in the cell share a common molecular structure and are called biomembranes. They consist mainly of lipids (phospholipids and sterols) and proteins, with some carbohydrates in glycoproteins or glycolipids. According to the fluid mosaic model, the membrane is a double layer of lipids with proteins attached or embedded. Lipids and proteins are mobile, and this fluidity is essential for membrane function.</p>

<p>The lipid bilayer forms a selectively permeable barrier that maintains the distribution of substances on both sides and participates in metabolism, transport, energy transformation, and signaling.</p>

<h3>Transport Across Membranes</h3>

<p>Biomembranes are selectively permeable, meaning they allow certain ions and organic molecules to pass while restricting others. This selectivity is essential for maintaining the internal environment of the cell.</p>

<p>Simple diffusion is the passive movement of small, non polar molecules (such as O₂ or CO₂) directly through the lipid bilayer, driven by a concentration gradient. Larger or charged molecules move by facilitated diffusion, which also requires no energy but depends on specific membrane proteins (channels or carriers) that assist their passage across the membrane.</p>

<p>In contrast, active transport moves substances against their concentration gradient and therefore requires metabolic energy, usually in the form of ATP. Membrane pumps and transport proteins enable cells to accumulate ions or nutrients or expel unwanted substances regardless of external concentrations.</p>

<h3>Osmosis</h3>

<p>Water moves across biomembranes by osmosis, flowing from regions of lower solute concentration (higher water potential) to regions of higher solute concentration (lower water potential). This passive movement is driven by the concentration gradient and continues until osmotic equilibrium is approached or countered by cell wall pressure.</p>

<p>In a hypertonic environment, water leaves the plant cell, the protoplast shrinks, and the plasma membrane detaches from the cell wall—a process known as plasmolysis.</p>

<p>At the opposite extreme, in a hypotonic environment, water enters the cell, the vacuole enlarges, and the cell becomes turgid. The resulting turgor pressure pushes the plasma membrane against the cell wall, which resists further expansion and mechanically supports the tissue.</p>

<p>The plasma membrane separates the cytoplasm from the cell wall and forms a highly selective barrier that controls the movement of substances into and out of the cell. In addition, biomembranes surround several organelles, including the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, plastids, the vacuole, and various microbodies such as lysosomes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Nucleus</h2>

<p>The nucleus is the most important membrane bound organelle within the eukaryotic cytoplasm, serving as the primary repository of the cell’s genetic information. It is enclosed by a double layered nuclear envelope, which contains numerous nuclear pores that regulate the exchange of molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.</p>

<p>Inside the nucleus, the nucleoplasm contains chromatin, a complex of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and histone proteins. Chromatin represents the genetic material in its extended form, while during cell division it condenses into visible chromosomes.</p>

<p>One or more nucleoli may be present; these dense structures are sites where ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is synthesized and where the initial steps of ribosome assembly occur.</p>

<p>Altogether, the nucleus functions as the central hub of genetic storage, regulation, and ribosomal biogenesis, controlling cell division, gene expression, and hereditary continuity.</p>

<h3>Ploidy</h3>
<p>Ploidy refers to the number of complete sets of chromosomes present in the nucleus of a cell. In eukaryotes, the basic state is usually: haploid (n) in gametes and diploid (2n) in somatic cells. However, especially plants commonly possess more than two sets of chromosomes (mainly 3n, 4n, 6n, 8n). This condition is called polyploidy.</p>

<p>Polyploidy represents an important evolutionary mechanism that contributes to increased genetic diversity, larger cell and organ size, or even reproductive isolation and formation of new species. Because of these advantages, polyploidy is widely used in plant breeding. Many crops, such as wheat, potato, banana, canola, cotton, sugarcane, and strawberry, are polyploid.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Plastids</h2>

<p>Plastids are lipoprotein organelles in plant cells containing their own DNA and ribosomes. They are surrounded by a double membrane and contain internal membranes and the stroma.</p>

<p><strong>Types:</strong><br>
– Chloroplasts – green, contain chlorophylls and carotenoids<br>
– Chromoplasts – colorful, contain carotenoids<br>
– Leucoplasts – colorless, store starch, proteins, or lipids</p>

<p>Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis. They have a system of thylakoids, forming grana and stroma thylakoids. Pigments are located in thylakoid membranes.</p>

<p>Chromoplasts form from chloroplasts or proplastids. Leucoplasts include amyloplasts (starch), proteinoplasts, and elaioplasts (lipids). Starch is stained with Lugol’s solution.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Mitochondria</h2>

<p>Mitochondria are smaller than plastids but also have a double membrane. The inner membrane forms folds called cristae or tubular invaginations. Mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Vacuole</h2>

<p>Vacuoles are membrane bound compartments filled with cell sap containing water, ions, sugars, proteins, and pigments. Young cells have many small vacuoles that fuse into one large vacuole occupying up to 90% of the cell volume. Pigments such as anthocyanins, flavones, and antofein may be dissolved in the vacuole and contribute to coloration depending on pH.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)</h2>

<p>Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) is a three dimensional membrane system used for internal transport.</p>
<p>– <strong>Rough ER</strong> has ribosomes and synthesizes proteins.<br>
– <strong>Smooth ER</strong> lacks ribosomes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Golgi Apparatus</h2>
<p>The Golgi Apparatus is formed by dictyosomes and is involved in secretion.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Ribosomes</h2>
<p>Ribosomes are non membrane particles made of rRNA and proteins; their function is protein synthesis. They may be free or attached to membranes. Groups of ribosomes form polysomes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Cytoskeleton</h2>
<p>A network of protein fibers (microtubules and microfilaments) that gives the cell structure, enables movement, and organizes the interior.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Cell Inclusions</h2>
<p>Non living components that arise during cell metabolism, such as:<br>
– starch grains<br>
– protein bodies<br>
– lipids and oils<br>
– calcium oxalate crystals.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>Using a light microscope in the laboratory or classroom, the cell wall, nucleus with nucleoli, plastids, and sometimes vacuoles and cell inclusions (crystals) can be clearly observed. Unfortunately, mitochondria or the membrane systems like the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, can be observed only with an electron microscope.</p>

<p>In living plant cells, the cytoplasm usually moves; this movement is called cyclosis. It enables rapid substance exchange within the cell. We distinguish between cytoplasmic rotation, where the cell contents move in one direction along the cell wall around the central vacuole, and circulation, where cytoplasm flows in various directions around the walls and in strands between vacuoles.</p>

<p>Rotation of the cytoplasm can be observed well in the leaf cells of <em>Elodea canadensis</em> through the rotating chloroplasts.</p>
